## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Learned about the box shadow that I applied on the white cards. 
Struggled to resize svg images for the mobile version. 
Struggled also to find icons that are for free. 
Making everything look responsive on the mobile device was the hard part here as usual because of the svgs images that were not moving.
